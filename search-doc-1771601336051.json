But don't worry, we can carry them into this year and accomplish them now. Sometimes, I can not complete everything on my to-do list. However, I have made progress on each task, and that is still growth. Just chill and get better every day. Recently, I have been stuck with some study projects in my graduate school. It is a big change 🥲 when I was working, I could just type a few keywords into Google and find some documents to solve my problems. But in an academic environment, the information is not just in technical documents; it is also in published papers and their citations. I have spent so much time just trying to understand half of a paper! LOL 😂 To be honest, after work and studying, I feel a bit lazy.

But please keep in mind that AI agents are not perfect. They can make mistakes, and they require human oversight to ensure accuracy and reliability. However, when used correctly, they can be powerful allies in our work.  One thing I really like about AI assistants is that they can efficiently complete my tasks, as long as I know how to complete them 😅.

You might look at a generated line of Python code and think, &quot;Wow, that's clean/well-architected!&quot;, but a Python developer might look at the same code and point out that it's unoptimized, introduces too many changes to the codebase, or simply doesn't follow best practices.    For non-tech individuals, &quot;vibe-coding&quot; an app can be empowering. They can build something that solves a small problem or addresses a specific aspect they care about, leading to a satisfying &quot;Wow, it works!&quot; moment.  However, for technical people, the perspective is different. When we &quot;vibe-code&quot; or prototype with AI, we can't just stop at &quot;it works.&quot; We have to look at the codebase, the structure, optimization, and product requirements. Everything needs to be clearly defined so that the generated code is stable, consistent with the existing codebase, and maintainable in the future.  Some survey data from Stack Overflow in 2025 shows the reality of AI-generated code in the industry. Most respondents (72%) stated they do not practice &quot;vibe coding&quot;, with an additional 5% emphatically rejecting it as part of their workflow [ref]. Among over 31,000 survey participants, 66% of developers chose &quot;AI solutions that are almost right, but not quite,&quot; and 45% of developers said &quot;Debugging AI-generated code is more time-consuming&quot; [ref].

But optimization isn't always straightforward.  AI tends to increase pressure on specific points in your workflow. It can generate output effectively, but it can also generate &quot;garbage&quot; or create additional downstream work.    For example, when using AI to generate a blog post, you might get a draft very quickly. But this shifts the workload: now you have to read, edit, verify, and sometimes even rewrite significant portions. You've increased the pressure on the &quot;editing&quot; phase. If you simply add AI without removing redundant steps elsewhere in your process, you create an imbalance. You end up creating more work for one position instead of streamlining the whole process.    In software development, reviewers may need to spend more time examining the &quot;source code&quot; of team members, which can be more time-consuming than writing the code. Or, just send a text message &quot;LGTM&quot; 😂, no risk involved, trust me bro!  More developers actively distrust the accuracy of AI tools (46%) than trust it (33%), and only a fraction (3%) report &quot;highly trusting&quot; the output.

Some use-cases I can share:  Studying and learning: NotebookLM and Google AI Studio are my go-to tools for learning new topics and keeping updated with the latest research. What I prepare is a good prompt/form to guide the AI to give me the right information I need. Guiding AI to generate content following summarization frameworks like the Feynman Technique, PACES, or SQ3R effectively improves the quality of the output.    Coding tasks: GitHub Copilot is my main assistant for coding. It helps me write code faster and more efficiently, but I always review and optimize the generated code to ensure it meets my standards and fits well with the project's goals. Fortunately, Copilot has significantly improved its utility tools and integrates with various LLMs.  I also use Antigravity to access more LLM resources 😅 I like the way AI generates implementation plans that I can review and comment on to adjust. I think that IDE has a lot of work to do to surpass the experience offered by VS Code.  At this point, why GitHub Copilot? Nah, this isn't a recommendation, it's just me sharing my preference. My company provides the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, so I just want to use a &quot;tool&quot; to serve my workflow (work and personal tasks).  Automation tasks: Grok Tasks is a great tool for researching and automating repetitive tasks. I have some tasks about searching for newest papers and financial news.

The server receives those requests and processes them concurrently. Please look at the image below.    In the example above, both Client 1 and Client 2 make requests to the server. Each request is considered an async operation. As the number of requests increases, the number of asynchronous operations that need to be executed also grows.  Now, let's talk about batching.    Still using the example with Client 1 and Client 2, but this time, their requests are batched together and processed in just one async operation. By doing this, when the operation completes, both clients are notified, even though the async operation is actually executed only once.  This approach offers a remarkably simple yet powerful way to optimize the load of an application. It avoids the complexity of caching mechanisms, which often require robust memory management and invalidation strategies.

Its task is to retrieve quantity information for hundreds of thousands of products from the database.  The schema used for this example is a simple table with three fields.  CREATE TABLE sales ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, product varchar(255), quantity bigint )   The data processing operation is straightforward. It involves retrieving all records with the corresponding product and calculating their total quantity. The algorithm is intentionally slow as we want to highlight the effect of batching and caching later on. The routine would look as follows (file totalQuantity.js):  ./totalQuantity.js import db from './database.js'; export async function totalQuantity(product) { const now = Date.now(); let sql = `SELECT product, quantity FROM sales WHERE product=?`; let total = 0; return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { db.all(sql, [product], (err, rows) =&gt; { if (err) return reject(); rows.forEach((row) =&gt; { total += row.quantity; }) console.log(`totalQuantity() took: ${Date.now() - now}ms`); resolve(total); }) }) }   Now, I will expose the totalQuantity API through a simple Express.js server (the server.js file):  ./server.js import express from 'express'; import { totalQuantity } from './totalQuantity.js'; const app = express(); const PORT = 8000; app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; { res.send('Hello World!'); }) app.get('/total-quantity', async (req, res) =&gt; { const { product } = req.query; const total = await totalQuantity(product); res.status(200).json({ product, total }) }) app.listen(PORT, () =&gt; { console.log(`Example app listening on PORT ${PORT}`) })   Before starting the server, we will generate some sample data.

To run the test, just execute the following command:  node loadTest.js   Note the total time taken for the test.    The results of 3 test runs are 994ms, 954ms, 957ms ~ avg 968ms.

This is where we implement the mechanism of the batching pattern.  Now, imagine working with caching without worrying about cache invalidation. That makes it much easier to understand.  We will use a memory space to store the promises that need to be processed (it could be an array, map, dict, etc.). And we will differentiate them based on the input of the request. New requests with the same input will reference the promises stored in the memory space. When the promises complete, they will return results to all the requests referencing them, and then we will remove them from the memory space.  Now it's time to code.  ./totalQuantityBatch.js import { totalQuantity as totalQuantityRaw } from &quot;./totalQuantity.js&quot;; const requestsQueue = new Map(); export function totalQuantity(product) { if (requestsQueue.has(product)) { console.log(&quot;Batching...&quot;) return requestsQueue.get(product); } const promise = totalQuantityRaw(product); requestsQueue.set(product, promise); promise.finally(() =&gt; { requestsQueue.delete(product) }) return promise; }   The totalQuantity function of totalQuantityBatch module can be considered a proxy for totalQuantityRaw function of totalQuantity module, let's see how it works:  In line 3, I define the variable requestsQueue as a Map to serve as temporary memory.From line 6-8, we check if a request with the input “product” already exists in the temporary memory. If it does, we return the stored promises.From line 11-14, If the input “product” does not exist, we start executing the totalQuantityRaw function and store it in the temporary memory. One nice thing is that we can leverage .finally to attach a callback that removes the promise from the temporary memory.In line 16, return running promise.  After completing the logic in the totalQuantityBatch module, we need to update the server.js to incorporate the new logic.  ./server.js import express from 'express'; // import { totalQuantity } from './totalQuantity.js'; import { totalQuantity } from './totalQuantityBatch.js'; ...   Restart the server and let's see how the results change.    Let’s run the loadTest.js script:    The results of 3 test runs are 624ms, 648ms, 592ms ~ avg 621ms.  We can clearly see that the processing time for all requests has been significantly reduced.

You might consider using LRU (Least Recently Used) or FIFO (First In, First Out) methods for data management.You can also apply caching to enhance the effectiveness of this technique and standardize the stored data for easier sharing. Of course, you will need to address the issue of cache invalidation.When the application is distributed across multiple processes and instances, storing data in memory in different locations can lead to inconsistent results and become redundant.

Currently, many packages can help you monitor your FastAPI app. The package I like to use the most is Prometheus FastAPI Instrumentator (919 stars, 83 forks on 03/09/2024). I often use it along with Prometheus and Grafana, creating visual dashboards from those metrics helps me easily monitor the application. I will discuss this stack in another article.    How it’s work?  The API server exports an endpoint /metrics, which tracks the HTTP request count, request/response size in bytes, request duration, and more.We register the /metrics endpoint and set the crawl job duration for the Prometheus service. Next, this service automatically ingests metrics data from the API server, storing the collected data for analysis.Grafana acts as an admin dashboard, retrieving data from Prometheus and visualizing it in specialized graphs, such as time-series, line charts.

What is it?  The reason for this is that Docker network works differently on Linux, Windows, and macOS.On Linux, Docker uses the system's built-in networking features.But on Windows and macOS, Docker runs inside a virtual machine. Because of this, Windows and macOS need a special way for containers to talk to the host machine, which is why we use host.docker.internal.  Since my OS is Windows, I'm using it as the host for the Prometheus service so that it can call the FastAPI server, which is not containerized.

After a few weeks or months, you get a task related to that code. That's where the nightmare begins.  To solve that problem, we should group the declarations of the variables we need to use together. And I found a way to do that while keeping our code clean and readable.  We can use operator module from the standard library as follows:  from operator import itemgetter current_user = { &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;username&quot;: &quot;pxuanbach&quot;, &quot;email&quot;: &quot;pxuanbach@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;phone&quot;: &quot;832819201&quot;, &quot;full_name&quot;: &quot;Bach Pham&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;: &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;website&quot;: &quot;immersedincode.io.vn&quot; } id, email, gender, username = itemgetter( 'id', 'email', 'gender', 'username' )(current_user) print(&quot;Id:&quot;, id, &quot;- Email:&quot;, email, &quot;- Gender:&quot;, gender, &quot;- Username:&quot;, username) # Id: 1 - Email: pxuanbach@gmail.com - Gender: Male - Username: pxuanbach   In the example above, the value of each variable will correspond to the order of keys in the itemgetter function.

It puts a cap on how often someone can repeat an action within a certain timeframe – for instance, trying to log in to an account. Rate limiting can help stop certain kinds of malicious bot activity. It can also reduce strain on web servers.— By Cloud Flare —  Besides, it also offers other benefits, such as monitoring API usage, enforcing API usage policies, and even implementing some business logic to differentiate customer permission levels.  There are many types of rate-limiting to meet various needs, including Fixed Window Counter, Sliding Window Counter, Token Bucket, and more. Additionally, rule limiting is also a topic of concern. I will introduce Fixed Window Counter rate-limiting in this article with an IP-based limiting mechanism.

Therefore, if more than 2 requests are sent from the Client, starting from the 3rd request, an error will occur and it will be responded to immediately.  Perhaps you are curious as to why the 1-minute time frame is not calculated from point (1) but rather from point (2). To understand this, you'll need to learn about Rate-Limit algorithms. If the time were calculated from point (1) and I could successfully make 2 requests after 1 minute, that would be the Fixed Window Counter algorithm. I calculate the time from point (2) because I am applying the Sliding Window Counter algorithm.  Fixed Window Counter algorithm can be described as follows:    We still use the 2 requests per minute rule.R1 and R2 belong to Frame 1, and both responded successfully. At this point, Server will count R1 and R2, with count = 2.R3 failed because Frame 1 reached limit (count = 2 = limit).R5 and R6 belong to Frame 2, and do the same with R1, R2.  Sliding Window Counter algorithm can be described as follows:    R1 was successful because Frame 1 had no previous requests. We store R1 with time = 60.R2 also executes successfully. Because in Frame 2, there is only 1 request, which is R1 (count = 1). At this stage, we adds R2 with time = 75 to cache.R3 failed because Frame 3 reached limit. We will check how many requests have been stored from around 30 to 90. Oh, we have R1 and R2 with corresponding times of 60 and 75.R4 was successful because Frame 4 only contains R2 (count = 1).

First, the request will pass through the Rate-limit middleware, which will check whether this request is allowed to proceed to the next middleware or the execution layer.    When working with FastAPI, we have many ways to implement this module. I can list a few methods as follows:  Take advantage of the Dependencies feature in FastAPI.Use Python's decorator feature.Build a middleware in the FastAPI application, similar in concept to Global Dependencies.  In this article, I choose option 1 for simplicity and efficiency.  “Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.” 😁  Next, I will create a rate-limit class.

The special thing is that when the system is operating, you can't always sit next to the screen to check whether that function records errors or not? And at what point does the error occur? Ha ha… a classic example.  To solve that problem, log formatting is the key solution. It helps you and your system get through the darkest days.

If we only print to the console, when we restart the application, the logs on the console will be reset... We have lost all the old logs.  So, we need to store logs to multiple sources. As far as I know, we can store locations like files, databases, or online log services.  You can integrate with other tools like Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK Stack).    Or Promtail, Loki and Grafana for simpler setup.    In this post, we will discuss how to log into a file and some considerations to remember regarding this process.  With just a few lines of code, you can log into a specific file anywhere you want.  ./app/core/logger.py # Create the root logger. logger = logging.getLogger() logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) # Set up logging to the file. file_handler = logging.FileHandler('app.log') # &lt;--- File location file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') file_handler.setFormatter(formatter) logger.addHandler(file_handler)   Let’s see the results.    As you can see, app.log automatically creates and contains all the logs we print. However, that's not enough. We cannot simply dump all the system logs into a single file and monitor the logs from there. It is terrible! (＃°Д°)  To avoid that, what we need is a log rotation. It helps us manage file size, the maximum number of backup files if the file size exceeds the threshold.  ./app/core/logger.py # Define default logfile format. file_name_format = &quot;{year:04d}{month:02d}{day:02d}.log&quot; # Define the default logging message formats. file_msg_format = &quot;%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s: %(message)s&quot; console_msg_format = &quot;%(levelname)s: %(message)s&quot; # Define the log rotation criteria. max_bytes = 1024**2 # ~ 1MB backup_count = 100 # Create the root logger. logger = logging.getLogger() logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) # Validate the given directory. dir=&quot;log&quot; dir = os.path.normpath(dir) # Create a folder for the logfiles. if not os.path.exists(dir): os.makedirs(dir) # Construct the name of the logfile. t = datetime.datetime.now() file_name = file_name_format.format( year=t.year, month=t.month, day=t.day, ) file_name = os.path.join(dir, file_name) # Set up logging to the logfile. file_handler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler( filename=file_name, maxBytes=max_bytes, backupCount=backup_count ) file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) file_formatter = logging.Formatter(file_msg_format) file_handler.setFormatter(file_formatter) logger.addHandler(file_handler)   If you're not familiar with how this module works, the RotatingFileHandler class has the following description:  Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly maxBytes in length. If backupCount is &gt;= 1, the system will successively create new files with the same pathname as the base file, but with extensions &quot;.1&quot;, &quot;.2&quot; etc. appended to it. For example, with a backupCount of 5 and a base file name of &quot;app.log&quot;, you would get &quot;app.log&quot;, &quot;app.log.1&quot;, &quot;app.log.2&quot;, ... through to &quot;app.log.5&quot;.

To clarify what we need, let's explore the concept of Redis a bit.  What is Redis?​  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open source, in-memory, NoSQL key/value store that is used primarily as an application cache or quick-response database.— By IBM —  So, to effectively use Redis as a cache, we need an efficient strategy for creating keys and values. Fortunately, Redis now supports various data types such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, and JSON…  Another thing to keep in mind is what to cache and how long to keep it in cache.  What to cache?​  We don't want to cache many keys that change continuously. We don't want to cache many keys that are requested very rarely. We want to cache keys that are requested often and change at a reasonable rate. For an example of key not changing at a reasonable rate, think of a global counter that is continuously INCRemented.— By Redis Docs —  How long to keep it?​  This is a question that you need to answer for yourself; everything depends on the logic of your system.  Some systems use Redis to implement a whitelist strategy for their authorization tokens, so the time to keep that key in the cache memory could be the token's lifespan.  They also implement data caching for high-traffic APIs with large response data, where the data returned from these APIs has minimal changes. The time to keep the key in the cache memory could be either the time it takes for a change to occur or just enough time to ensure users aren't stuck with outdated data for too long.  Suppose you have complex computational tasks that are time-consuming or require significant computational resources. In that case, you can use cron jobs (schedule jobs) to precompute the results and store them in the cache to optimize user experience and system resource utilization.  Next, let's take a quick look at this code snippet.  ./app/core/cache.py from typing import Any from urllib.parse import urlencode from fastapi import Request from fastapi.datastructures import QueryParams from app.core.redis import redis_client from app.utils import ORJsonCoder def query_params_builder(params: QueryParams) -&gt; str: sorted_query_params = sorted(params.items()) return urlencode(sorted_query_params, doseq=True) def req_key_builder(req: Request, **kwargs): return &quot;:&quot;.join([ req.method.lower(), req.url.path, query_params_builder(req.query_params) ]) async def add(req: Request, data: Any, expire: int = 60): cached = await redis_client.add_to_cache(req_key_builder(req), data, expire) if not cached: return False return True async def check_exist(req: Request) -&gt; str: key = req_key_builder(req) ttl, in_cache = await redis_client.check_cache(key) return in_cache def load_cache_data(data: str): return ORJsonCoder().decode(data)   query_params_builder: The order of sent query parameters may be inconsistent. Therefore, we need a function to ensure consistency for the query parameters.req_key_builder: This function is used to create a unique key based on the incoming request. The value of the key will look like get:/api/v1/users:limit=20&amp;skip=0.add: As the name suggests, add a key/value pair to Redis with the corresponding parameters.check_exist: Used to check whether the data exists in the cache or not.load_cache_data: Simply used to decode the data retrieved from the cache.

First, connect to Redis.  ./app/main.py from fastapi import FastAPI from contextlib import asynccontextmanager from app.core.config import settings from app.core.redis import redis_client @asynccontextmanager async def lifespan(app: FastAPI): # start up await redis_client.connect(str(settings.REDIS_URL)) yield # shut down await redis_client.disconnect() app = FastAPI( title=settings.PROJECT_NAME, openapi_url=f&quot;{settings.API_STR}{settings.API_VERSION_STR}/openapi.json&quot;, lifespan=lifespan )   Second, let's do a simple example. I have an API that returns user information as follows.  ./app/api/user.py @router.get(&quot;&quot;, response_model=List[User]) async def get_pagination_cache( skip: int = Query(0), limit: int = Query(20), session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_async_session) ) -&gt; Any: data = await user.get_pagination(session, skip, limit) return data   Now I will implement caching logic for this API. In FastAPI, you can use Background Tasks to cache asynchronously, which reduces system load and request latency.  ./app/api/user.py @router.get(&quot;&quot;, response_model=List[User]) async def get_pagination_cache( request: Request, bg_tasks: BackgroundTasks, skip: int = Query(0), limit: int = Query(20), session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_async_session) ) -&gt; Any: in_cache = await cache.check_exist(req=request) if in_cache: return cache.load_cache_data(in_cache) data = await user.get_pagination(session, skip, limit) bg_tasks.add_task(cache.add, req=request, data=data, expire=60) return data   When a user calls this API, it will check the corresponding key in Redis. If this key exists, it will return the value of the key without querying the database. If the key does not exist, the system will query the database to retrieve the data as usual. Once the data is obtained, we return it and simultaneously store it in the cache with an expiration time of 60 seconds.  I will insert approximately 20,000 records and use the /users API to retrieve that information. The larger the data, the more noticeable the difference in response time will be.  Let's see what changes now. In the first usage, the API response time falls around 223 ms.    In the second usage, the response time falls around 136 ms.    If you have Redis Insight on your machine, you can connect to Redis and view the values stored within it.    Additionally, you will need to pay attention to response headers such as Cache-Control, ETag, Vary,…  Some packages that you may be interested in:  long2ice/fastapi-cache (github.com) (1.1k stars, 132 forks on 18/04/2024)madkote/fastapi-plugins (github.com) (334 stars, 19 forks on 18/04/2024)comeuplater/fastapi_cache (github.com) (208 stars, 16 forks on 18/04/2024)a-luna/fastapi-redis-cache (github.com) (143 stars, 23 forks on 18/04/2024)mailgun/expiringdict (github.com) (335 stars, 75 forks on 18/04/2024)  ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Conclusion​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Essential modules for developing applications with FastAPI (P3 - Caching)","url":"/blog/essential-modules-for-developing-applications-with-fastapi-p3-caching#conclusion","content":" Well, that’s it.

And the maximum retry time to check the status of the container. The value depends on your container initialization time.Execute the docker command to find the inactive service and start it.Check the status of the newly initialized container.Update Nginx configuration and reload it. Using nginx -s reload to reload Nginx usually does not cause downtime. This is because the command only tells Nginx to reload its configuration, it does not restart the entire process.Clean up some unused stuff (old docker image, old container).  In some cases the command docker compose rm -fsv may not work. Easily change it to:  docker compose stop $ACTIVE_SERVICE docker compose rm -f $ACTIVE_SERVICE   To deploy the new version, simply run the created script.  ./pull.run-service.sh   Conclusion  As you can see, we can automate the deployment process with just 1 Bash script. The primary objective is to redirect the proxy to the newest container and then remove the old one.  If you need a project to run a demo on your environment, here are my Git repository.

It's APScheduler (6k stars, 693 forks on 28/07/2024). If you are wondering why, the answer comes from a ticket in my job, which required adding a feature to schedule certain tasks during the day in the FastAPI application. Then, I wandered through various blogs, forums, and stopped at a discussion in the FastAPI repository. Many libraries were mentioned, and then I stopped here.  This library supports job storage with SQLAlchemy (SQLAlchemyJobStore) and job scheduling with asyncio (AsyncIOScheduler).  This library has three built-in scheduling systems  Cron-style scheduling (with optional start/end times)Interval-based execution (runs jobs on even intervals, with optional start/end times)One-off delayed execution (runs jobs once, on a set date/time)  So, we can organize the module flexibly to take advantage of those benefits.

That means there will be APIs performing CRD operations for it (no need for U - Update, because we only need to delete and re-add that job back into the system).  We will have a separate database to store jobs, typically I will use SQLite or PostgreSQL. It's lightweight and compatible with SQLAlchemy (SQLAlchemyJobStore).  In practice, I almost exclusively work with tasks that use cron or interval triggers. I rarely use date. However, for the sake of completeness in this article, I will also write APIs to support it.

As mentioned above, we will create an API to be able to create a new job while the application is running.  Schema/Model​  The payload schema would look as follows:  ./app/models/job.py from datetime import datetime from typing import Any, List, Literal, Optional, Union from sqlmodel import SQLModel class CronArgs(SQLModel): year: Optional[str] = &quot;*&quot; month: Optional[str] = &quot;*&quot; day: Optional[str] = &quot;*&quot; week: Optional[str] = &quot;*&quot; day_of_week: Optional[str] = &quot;*&quot; hour: Optional[str] = &quot;*&quot; minute: Optional[str] = &quot;*&quot; second: Optional[str] = &quot;5&quot; class IntervalArgs(SQLModel): seconds: Optional[int] = 10 minutes: Optional[int] = None hours: Optional[int] = None days: Optional[int] = None weeks: Optional[int] = None class DateArgs(SQLModel): args: List[Any] = [] run_date: datetime = datetime.now() class JobCreate(SQLModel): job_id: str from_file: bool = True type: Literal['cron', 'interval', 'date'] = 'cron' args: Optional[Union[DateArgs, IntervalArgs, CronArgs]] = None   In this example, the API can create all 3 types of jobs simultaneously, so I designed it as above. However, it might be beneficial to decouple these functionalities for improved maintainability and extensibility.  API Logic​  Next, let's take a quick look at this code snippet.  ./app/api/jobs.py @router.post(&quot;&quot;, response_model=JobCreateDeleteResponse) async def add_job_to_scheduler(obj_in: JobCreate) -&gt; JobCreateDeleteResponse: # Find job folder job_folder = path.join(&quot;app&quot;, settings.JOB_DIR, obj_in.job_id) if not path.exists(job_folder): raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail=&quot;Job folder not found.&quot;) _timers = obj_in.args # Get timer parameters if `.schedule` file exists if obj_in.from_file: _timers = {} _sched_path = path.join(job_folder, &quot;.schedule&quot;) if not path.exists(_sched_path): raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, detail=&quot;Schedule file not found&quot;) # read parameters from `.schedule` file sched = read_file_line_by_line(_sched_path) for i in range(len(sched)): if i == 0 or str(sched[i]).startswith('#') or sched[i] == '' or sched[i] is None: continue _interval_timer = str(sched[i]).split(&quot;=&quot;) _timers.update({_interval_timer[0]: _interval_timer[1]}) # Get cron-job timer parameters if type equals &quot;cron&quot; if obj_in.type == &quot;cron&quot;: _timers = CronArgs.model_validate(_timers) # Get interval-job timer parameters if type equals &quot;interval&quot; elif obj_in.type == &quot;interval&quot;: _timers = IntervalArgs.model_validate(_timers) # Get date-off job timer parameters if type equals &quot;date&quot; elif obj_in.type == &quot;date&quot;: _timers = DateArgs.model_validate(_timers) # find job module in `./app/jobs` folder, # register the `call` function inside the module to the scheduler with timer parameters _job_module = importlib.import_module(f&quot;app.jobs.{obj_in.job_id}.main&quot;) try: job = scheduler.add_job( _job_module.call, obj_in.type, id=obj_in.job_id, **_timers.model_dump(exclude_none=True) ) except ConflictingIdError: logging.warning(f&quot;Job {obj_in.job_id} already exists&quot;) raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_409_CONFLICT, detail=&quot;Job already exists&quot;) except Exception as e: logging.error(f&quot;Add job {obj_in.job_id} - {str(e)}&quot;) raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail=&quot;An error occurred&quot;) return JobCreateDeleteResponse(scheduled=True, job_id=job.id)   How does it work?  From line 4-6, to register a job, we must define the job into ./app/jobs folder. The name of the job folder must be equal to the job_id. For example: From line 10-31, I provide 2 options to create a new job. Register with .schedule file, this file will be placed in the job folder.Register via API payload (Schema/Model) that I mentioned above. In line 35, import the module dynamically using job_id via the importlib library. From line 37-42, try to register the job into the scheduler's job store.  We will test it later. Next I will introduce the Get all jobs API.

First, I create a cron-job and look at the logs. As you can see, the job has been successfully registered in the job store and runs every 10 seconds.  Now, delete it using the delete_job.py script and create an interval job.    Wow, it’s work. Then test the Get all jobs API using get_list_jobs.py script.

To address this issue, you can separate it into a dedicated application specifically for executing scheduled jobs. Your main application can call the job scheduler app via HTTP, GRPC, etc., to register jobs into the job store.Beyond AsyncIOScheduler, APScheduler offers a variety of job schedulers and storage options.
