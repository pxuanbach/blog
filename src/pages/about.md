# This is how it all startedâ€¦

Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Bach Pham. I am a software engineer working in the web development industry. 

<!--truncate-->

I share the knowledge and experience I have gained throughout my work and study on this blog. It also serves as a repository of knowledge and solutions for me to refer back to when needed.

In the field of software development in general, and web application development in particular, frameworks and libraries are constantly popping up like mushrooms after a rain shower. This forces us to continually adapt and learn new knowledge to serve our work. However, there is too much information... so I decided to memorize keywords about them and store them somewhere, so that if necessary, I can find and reuse them.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}>
    <div style={{width: '160px', marginRight: '20px'}}> 
        <img src={require('../../static/img/logo-large.png').default} alt="Immersed in Code Logo"/>
    </div>
    
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', justifyContent: 'center', height: 'auto' }}>
