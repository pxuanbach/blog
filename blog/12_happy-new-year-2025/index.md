Hi everyone, I hope you and your family are all doing well! ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†

A new year has arrived, many goals from the previous year remain unfinished. But don't worry, we can carry them into this year and accomplish them now.

<!--truncate-->

Sometimes, I can not complete everything on my to-do list. However, I have made progress on each task, and that is still growth.

**Just chill and get better every day.**

Recently, I have been stuck with some study projects in my graduate school. 

It is a big change ðŸ¥² when I was working, I could just type a few keywords into Google and find some documents to solve my problems. But in an academic environment, the information is not just in technical documents; it is also in published papers and their citations. 

I have spent so much time just trying to understand half of a paper! LOL ðŸ˜‚

To be honest, after work and studying, I feel a bit lazy. So I have not been writing new posts lately, even though I have a lot of ideas for them. 

I think I should add a new task to my to-do list: *writing new blog posts*.
